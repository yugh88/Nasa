# *Orrery Web App*
=====================================

## Project Summary
---------------

The Dynamic orrery web application is an interactive too for exploring our solar
system. The tool plots, at various scales, positions and motions of celestial bodies, including planets, Near-Earth
Comets (NECs), Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). The objective is to enhance
educational experiences through a realistic view of celestial mechanics as well as supporting mission planning in space
exploration.
